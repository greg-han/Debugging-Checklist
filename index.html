        <h1>Your a new programer and your stuck.</h1>
        <p>Try these suggestions and see if you can get your project working.</p>
        <p>These suggestions are independent of language. 
        Each section ends with "Ask for help." 
        If you ask for help too early it is hard to learn and gain confidence. 
        If you wait to long you waist time and energy. 
        I try to balance these two concerns. 
        As long as you are making progress keep trying.</p>
        <ul>Signs of progress are:
        <li>Knowing when the error occurs</li>
        <li>Getting new error messages</li>
        <li>Limiting where an error could be coming from.</li>
