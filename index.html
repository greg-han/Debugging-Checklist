        <h1>Your a new programer and your stuck.</h1>
        <p>Try these suggestions and see if you can get your project working.</p>
        <p>These suggestions are independent of language.
        Each section ends with "Ask for help."
        If you ask for help too early it is hard to learn and gain confidence.
        If you wait to long you waist time and energy.
        I try to balance these two concerns.
        As long as you are making progress keep trying.</p>
        <ul>Signs of progress are:
        <li>Knowing when the error occurs</li>
        <li>Getting new error messages</li>
        <li>Limiting where an error could be coming from.</li>

        <h2>Flow Chart For Complete Newbies on
          what to do when Code Doesn’t work</h2>
        <h2>My Code Won’t Run / I got an error or other message
            - (usually Syntax errors or Compile Time errors):</h2>
        <ol>Syntax errors are the best kind of error to have.
            They always come with error messages.
            Error messages are kindly bud dumb genies telling you where your
            code is confusing the computer.
            (about half the time the computer is wrong about what should be fix)
            <li><ul>What to Look for in error messages:
                <li>What line in your program</li>
                <li>What the computer wants / key words</li>
                <li>Look for Red or messages</li></ol>
            <li>On your line? Syntax, number/type/order of arguments, wrong type of function for type/array (in weakly typed goes other place)</li>
            <li>Before your line? Closing braces ";" initialization…</li>
            <li>Proof read check spelling and variable names</li>
            <li>Be your computer (sometimes your variables don't have what you think they do)</li>
            <li>Google language + key word</li>
            <li>Comment out your line</li>
            <li>Retype / try your program line by line checking to see if it works</li>
            <li>Close and reopen IDE, turn off computer</li>
            <li>Ask for Help (get variations + explaining helps + get new error/problem + celebrate new line)</li>
          </ol>
          <ol>My Code runs and crashes or runs forever – (usually Run-time error):
              <p>Don't change things randomly it causes distractions / creating other error / makes version control hard</p>
            <li>Add logs of output, check if program is making progress, where is it taking time</li>
            <li>Proof read</li>
            <li>Be your computer</li>
            <li>Trace the decision tree.</li>
            <li>Retype / try your program line by line checking to see if it works</li>
            <li>Close and reopen IDE, turn off computer</li>
            <li>Comment out blocks of code</li>
            <li>look for loops or requests </li>
            <li>is there anything you can Google</li>
            <li>Ask for Help</li>
          </ol>
          <ol>My Code runs but I don’t understand what it is doing or it does nothing – (usually logic errors):
              <p>Don't change things randomly it causes distractions / creating other error / version control</P>
            <li>Look for what line/s in your code created the output you see</li>
            <li>Be your computer</li>
            <li>Add logs/ break point in your debugger</li>
            <li>Comment out blocks of code</li>
            <li>Ask why is the computer putting this out?</li>
            <li>Look for flow control statements (loop, if …, switch) Check to see what parts of you code are running</li>
            <li>Retype / proofread your code</li>
            <li>Ask for help</li>
          </ol>
          <ol>I don't even no where to begin learning  about this tool or code:
            <li>Install make sure it is on you computer</li>
            <li>if exe try running it (usually not helpful but worth a try)</li>
            <li>YouTube name of program or tool and your operating system</li>
            <li>Tutorials / examples</li>
            <li>Google name of program or tool and your operating system</li>
            <li>Try to get an error message</li>
            <li>Ask For Help</li>
          </ol>
          <p>Problems that go unnoticed
          Security – a risk when you store private data or interact with users
          Malicious user input (when ever you take data from users, corrupt user data)
          Transmission and storage of private data
           Authentication
          Lost access when passwords are lost
          Memory Leaks

          Overwrite or Corrupt Data
          When you copy or store data
          Over run of arrays in some languages
          Scaling
          Bad UX and bad users
          Too big, small, null, wrong type, etc…
          Landmines how code brakes
          functions should work correctly and brake spectacularly
          Suggestions by type of statement
          If then
          Never nest if-statements more than two deep and always try to do them one deep.
          Put blank lines before and after.
          Your boolean tests should be simple. If they are complex, move their calculations to variables earlier in your function and use a good name for the variable.
          Watch for all or nothing cases not covered. In "complete" lists. Practice for getting user input. Use of laundry/grocery lists vs example lists;
          Conditional
          For loops
          Do while loops
          While loops
          Not while loop or Unless loop
          try blocks
          functions and methods
          timing
          Suggestions for style and structure
          where and when to comment
          "Make sure parts of your programs work as you work on them. Do not write massive files of code before you try to run them. Code a little, run a little, fix a little."
          Code openings and closings together. "" () begin end {} '' || [] For next/end
          For Code challenges
          if you don't understand what you are supposed to do run and see what the test are.
          For for white board challenges:
          0 Question
          1 Algorithm
          2 complexity
          3 Test cases
          4 Code
          5 Proof (optional)
          Guideline for writing a tutorial
          Start from non working code
          Teach to the errors. Show people what errors they can get and what it means.</p>
